Real-time Twitter Sentiment Analysis for Brand Improvement and Topic Tracking
Web App GIF

Dive into the industry and get my hands dirty. That's why I start this self-motivated independent project.

Try this awesome Real-Time Twitter Monitoring System here on Heroku server. Read a series of related articles below:

Chapter 1: Collecting Twitter Data using Streaming Twitter API with Tweepy, MySQL, & Python
Chapter 2: Twitter Sentiment Analysis and Interactive Data Visualization using RE, TextBlob, NLTK, and Plotly

Chapter 4 (In Progress): Parallelize Streaming Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Scala, Kafka and Spark Streaming
Inspiration
The solution for evaluating Twitter data to perform better business decisions is to keep tracking all relevant Twitter content about a brand in real-time, perform analysis as topics or issues emerge, and detect anomaly with alert. By monitoring brand mentions on Twitter, brands could inform enagement and deliver better experiences for their customers across the world.

Interesting facts from exploratory data analysis
Less 0.01% users will push tweets with their locations.
Tweets grabbed from streaming data won't have more than 0 LIKE or RETWEET, since you have already captured them even before others press buttons :p
More than 65.6% users will write the locations in their profile, although very few of them don't live on Earth according to that fact.
The numbers of positive and negative tweets are relatively close and stay low compared with neural tweet number. Unless emergency events happen, lines won't fluctuate acutely.
Technical Approach - Version 2 ( ~ Sep 16)
Build ETL pipelines based on stream processing using Kafka (In Progress)
Perform sentiment analysis using Spark Streaming (In Progress)
Orignal Development - Version 1.2 (DoneðŸŽ‰)
Extract streaming Twitter Data, preprocess data in Python, and load data into MySQL for storage
Perform exploratory data analysis with Pandas & Seaborn to explore the insights
Connect with Plotly for real-time interactive dashboard based on time series
Deploy the real-time interactive front-end web app using Dash & Heroku PostgreSQL on Heroku server
Quick Demo
Real-time Interactive Web App on Heroku server
web app has been deployed on Heroku.

Real-time Twitter Sentiment Analysis in Jupyter Notebook
Try this interactive data visuilization in Jupyter Notebook. To run with streaming data, you need to deploy it locally.

Complex Dashboard

Get Started
Pre-installation
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set-up
Create a file called credentials.py and fill in the following content

# Go to http://apps.twitter.com and create an app.
# The consumer key and secret will be generated for you
API_KEY = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
API_SECRET_KEY = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

# After the step above, you will be redirected to your app's page.
# Create an access token under the the "Your access token" section
ACCESS_TOEKN = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
Create local MySQL database with info below

host="localhost"
user="root"
passwd="password"
database_table="TwitterDB"
Track Word Setting (Optional)
You can change the TRACK_WORDS in settings.py into any word, brand, or topic you're interested.

Stream the complex visualization
To perform streaming processing on dashboard, you need to deploy all settings above as well as let Main.ipynb keep listening.

Run
Run Main.ipynb to start scraping data on Jupter Notebook.

Run Analysis.ipynb to perform data analysis for brand improvement after Main.ipynb starts running.

Run Trend_Analysis_Complex to track topic trends on Twitter after Main.ipynb starts running.

Note: Since streaming process is always on, press STOP button to finsih.

Dash Web Application
All things related to Dash App is placed in dash_app folder.

Challenges
Unstructured tweet texts may contain messy code and emoji characters
Some brands may take a long time to collection enough data to perform analysis on issue emerging since they target specify groups of people
Some hot words will uncover useful insights only after appearing more than 10k times on tweets
Plotly doesn't have well-document on reference making customize dashboard much harder
More challenges on the way, but Google, StackOverFlow, Towards Data Science, and GitHub will always be your best friends
